    "This notebook consists of the [DeepPavlov](https://github.com/deepmipt/DeepPavlov) code snippets. The snippets show how to interact with the text classification models that were specifically developed to be effective when training data is limited. The popular use case scenario for these models is to classify user utterances into one of the FAQ questions and retrieve the corresponding answer (autoFAQ models). As a testbed, we use the students’ FAQ from the [MIPT website](https://mipt.ru/english/). The FAQ contains the most popular first-year students' questions with corresponding answers.\n",

    "# Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "DeepPavlov contains several text classification models that work well on few training pairs. All the models are based on two major text representations: fastText word embeddings and tf-idf representation. The models described in the separated configuration files under the [config/faq](https://github.com/deepmipt/DeepPavlov/tree/master/deeppavlov/configs/faq) folder. The config file consists of four main sections: **dataset_reader**, **dataset_iterator**, **chainer**, and **train**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **dataset_iterator** specifies how to split the data into train, valid, test sets. The **chainer** section of the configuration files contains a pipeline of the required components to interact with the models, i.e. tokenizer, lemmatizer, tf-idf vectorizer, and others. The tokenizer splits a string into tokens, lemmatizer converts all tokens into lemmas. The tf-idf vectorizer transforms the lemmas into tf-idf vectors. The component’s input and output are defined in the **in** and **out** keys correspondingly.\n",

    "We are iPavlov, our story started in 2017 when we decided to build a conversational AI framework that on the one hand will contain all required NLP components to build chatbots and on the other hand will be easy to use. Our work resulted in releasing DeepPavlov library. Our lab at MIPT is honored with Facebook AI Academic Partnership and NVIDIA GPU Research Center status. We successfully combine research and extreme coding in our week-long DeepHack.me hackathons — DeepHack.Game, DeepHack.Q&A and DeepHack.RL. We serve a global AI community by organizing NIPS Conversational Challenge to evaluate state-of-the-art techniques in the field of dialog systems and collect open source dialog datasets."
